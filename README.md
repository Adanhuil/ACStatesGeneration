# Anticoherent States Generation

In this repository, you will find the parameters which are necessary to generate anticoherent spin states.

## Description of the protocol

Starting from a coherent state pointing in the $x$ direction, our protocol consists of a sequence of $n_{C}$ cycles, where each cycle (except the first) applies a rotation around the $y$-axis followed by a squeezing operation along $z$. The corresponding operations are described by the operators

$$ R_{y}(\theta) = e^{-iJ_{y}\theta}, \qquad S_{z}(\eta) = e^{-iJ_{z}^{2}\eta} $$

where $\theta$ and $\eta$ are the amplitudes of the rotation and the squeezing. Note that in the first cycle only the squeezing operation is applied. The final state of the system after $n_C$ cycles is then given by

$$ |\psi_{n_C}\rangle = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n_C}S_{z}(\eta_i)\,R_{y}(\theta_i)\right)|\psi_0\rangle. $$

with $\theta_1=0$.

## File structure

In the Data folder, you will find the files storing the parameters $\theta_i$ and $\eta_i$ ($i=1,2,\dots,n_C$) which maximise the anticoherence measures of spin states obtained via numerical optimisation. There is two types of file structure :

- Analytical parameters : For each number of qubits $N=2j$ (first column) are given the squeezing parameters $\eta_2$ and $\eta_3$ (second and third columns) as explained in our paper.
- Other files : For a given number of cycles (first column), we give the maximal anticoherence measure we obtained (second column) followed by the $n_C-1$ rotation parameters $\theta$ and then the $n_C$ squeezing parameters $\eta$. The files preceded by "OptimisedSqueezing" have the same structure and are obtained from an optimisation on the total squeezing duration.
